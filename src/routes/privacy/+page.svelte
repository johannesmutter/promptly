  <h3 id="RLVNTLGAL">Relevant Legal Bases</h3>
  <p>
      In the following, you will find an overview of the legal bases of the GDPR on which we process personal data. Please note that in addition to the provisions of the GDPR, national data protection regulations may apply in your or our
      country of residence. If, in individual cases, more specific legal bases are relevant, we will inform you of these in the privacy policy.
  </p>
  <ul>
      <li><strong>Consent (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a) GDPR)</strong> - The data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes.</li>
      <li>
          <strong>Performance of a contract and pre-contractual inquiries (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b) GDPR)</strong>
          - The processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party, or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract.
      </li>
      <li>
          <strong>Legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR)</strong> - The processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests
          are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject that require protection of personal data.
      </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
      In addition to the data protection regulations of the GDPR, national regulations on data protection apply in Germany. This includes, in particular, the Act on the Protection against Misuse of Personal Data in Data Processing
      (Federal Data Protection Act – BDSG). The BDSG contains, in particular, specific provisions on the right to information, the right to erasure, the right to object, the processing of special categories of personal data, the
      processing for other purposes, and the transmission, as well as automated individual decision-making, including profiling. Furthermore, it regulates data processing for the purposes of the employment relationship (§ 26 BDSG), in
      particular with regard to the establishment, execution, or termination of employment relationships and the consent of employees. In addition, state data protection laws of the individual federal states may apply.
  </p>

  <h2 id="SCRMTSR">Security Measures</h2>
  <p>
      In accordance with legal requirements and taking into account the state of the art, the implementation costs, and the nature, scope, context, and purposes of processing as well as the different likelihoods of occurrence and the
      extent of the threat to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, we implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of protection appropriate to the risk.
  </p>
  <p>
      These measures include, in particular, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data by controlling physical and electronic access to the data as well as the access, input, transmission, securing of availability,
      and separation of the data concerning them. Furthermore, we have established procedures that ensure the exercise of data subject rights, deletion of data, and responses to data threats. We also consider the protection of personal
      data already in the development or selection of hardware, software, and procedures, in accordance with the principle of data protection, through technology design and data protection-friendly default settings.
  </p>
  <h2 id="TRNSPRSDT">Transfer of Personal Data</h2>
  <p>
      In the course of our processing of personal data, it may happen that the data is transferred to other entities, companies, legally independent organizational units or persons, or that it is disclosed to them. For example, recipients
      of this data may include service providers entrusted with IT tasks or providers of services and content that are integrated into a website. In such cases, we observe the legal requirements and, in particular, conclude appropriate
      contracts or agreements that serve to protect your data with the recipients of your data.
  </p>
  <h2 id="DTAPRC3C">Data Processing in Third Countries</h2>
  <p>
      If we process data in a third country (i.e., outside the European Union (EU), the European Economic Area (EEA)) or if the processing takes place in the context of using the services of third parties or the disclosure or transmission
      of data to other persons, bodies or companies, this is done only in compliance with legal requirements.
  </p>
  <p>
      Subject to express consent or contractually or legally required transmission, we process or have the data processed only in third countries with a recognized level of data protection, contractual obligation by so-called standard
      protection clauses of the EU Commission, the existence of certifications or binding internal data protection regulations (Art. 44 to 49 GDPR, information page of the EU Commission:

  </p>
  <h2 id="DLTOFDAT">Deletion of Data</h2>
  <p>
      The data processed by us will be deleted in accordance with legal requirements as soon as their processing allowed consents are revoked or other permissions cease to apply (e.g., if the purpose of processing this data no longer
      applies or they are no longer necessary for the purpose). If the data is not deleted because it is required for other and legally permissible purposes, their processing will be restricted to these purposes. This means that the data
      is blocked and not processed for other purposes. This applies, for example, to data that must be retained for commercial or tax reasons or whose storage is necessary for the assertion, exercise or defense of legal claims or for the
      protection of the rights of another natural or legal person.
  </p>

  <h2 id="WEBANLMON">Web Analysis, Monitoring and Optimization</h2>
  <p>
      Web analysis (also referred to as "reach measurement") is used to evaluate the visitor traffic to our online offer and can include behavior, interests, or demographic information about visitors, such as age or gender, as
      pseudonymous values. With the help of reach analysis, we can, for example, recognize when our online offer or its functions or content are most frequently used or invite reuse. We can also understand which areas require
      optimization.
  </p>
  <p>
      In addition to web analysis, we can also use test procedures to test and optimize different versions of our online offer or its components.
  </p>
  <p>
      Unless otherwise indicated below, profiles can be created for these purposes, i.e. data summarized for a usage process and information stored in a browser or on an end device can be read from it. The information collected includes,
      in particular, visited web pages and elements used there, as well as technical information such as the browser used, the computer system used, and information on usage times. If users have agreed to the collection of their location
      data with us or with the providers of the services we use, location data may also be processed.
  </p>
  <p>
      The IP addresses of the users are also stored. However, we use an IP masking procedure (i.e., pseudonymization by shortening the IP address) to protect the users. In general, no clear data of users (such as email addresses or names)
      are stored as part of web analysis, A/B testing, and optimization, but rather pseudonyms. This means that we and the providers of the software used do not know the actual identity of the users, but only the information stored in
      their profiles for the purposes of the respective procedures.
  </p>
  <ul>
      <li><strong>Data types processed:</strong> Usage data (e.g. visited web pages, interest in content, access times); meta, communication and procedural data (e.g. IP addresses, timing, identification numbers, consent status).</li>
      <li><strong>Persons affected:</strong> Users (e.g. website visitors, users of online services).</li>
      <li><strong>Purposes of processing:</strong> Reach measurement (e.g. access statistics, recognition of returning visitors); Profiles with user-related information (creation of user profiles).</li>

  <h2 id="PLEMBDFC">Plugins and Embedded Functions as well as Content</h2>
  <p>
      We integrate functional and content elements into our online offering that are obtained from the servers of their respective providers (hereinafter referred to as "third-party providers"). These can be, for example, graphics,
      videos, or city maps (hereinafter collectively referred to as "content").
  </p>
  <p>
      The integration always requires that the third-party providers of this content process the IP address of the users, as without the IP address they could not send the content to their browser. The IP address is therefore necessary
      for the presentation of this content or function. We strive to only use content whose respective providers use the IP address solely for the delivery of the content. Third-party providers may also use so-called pixel tags (invisible
      graphics, also known as "web beacons") for statistical or marketing purposes. The "pixel tags" can be used to evaluate information such as visitor traffic on the pages of this website. The pseudonymous information can also be stored
      in cookies on the users' device and may contain technical information about the browser and operating system, referring web pages, the time of visit, as well as other information regarding the use of our online offering and may be
      linked with such information from other sources.

  <h2 id="DEFINITN">Definitions</h2>
  <p>
      In this section, you will find an overview of the terms used in this privacy policy. Many of the terms are taken from the law and defined primarily in Art. 4 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The legal definitions
      are binding. The following explanations are intended to serve primarily to aid in understanding. The terms are sorted alphabetically.
  </p>
  <ul class="definitions">
      <li><strong>Controller:</strong> The "controller" is the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data.</li>
      <li>
          <strong>Personal Data:</strong> "Personal data" means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (hereinafter referred to as the "data subject"); an identifiable natural person is one who can be
          identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier (e.g. cookie), or to one or more factors specific to the physical,
          physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural, or social identity of that natural person.
      </li>
      <li>
          <strong>Processing:</strong> "Processing" means any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organization,
          structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction.
      </li>
      <li>
          <strong>User Profiles:</strong> The processing of "user profiles" involves any kind of automated processing of personal data which consists of using such personal data to analyze, evaluate, or predict certain personal aspects
          relating to a natural person (depending on the type of profiling, different information concerning demographics, behavior and interests, such as interactions with websites and their content, etc. may be analyzed). For example,
          this can include interests in certain content or products, click behavior on a website, or location data. For the purposes of profiling, cookies and web beacons are often used.
      </li>
      <li>
          <strong>Web Analytics:</strong> Web analytics (also referred to as "reach measurement") is used to evaluate visitor traffic to an online offer and may include the behavior or interests of visitors to certain information, such as
          the content of web pages. With the help of reach analysis, website owners can, for example, recognize at what time visitors visit their website and what content they are interested in. This allows them to better tailor the
          content of the website to the needs of their visitors. Pseudonymous cookies and web beacons are often used for the purpose of reach analysis in order to recognize recurring visitors and to obtain more accurate analyses of the
          use of an online offer.
